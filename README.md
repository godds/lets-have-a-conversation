# Let's have a conversation

GRAHAM: Have you heard of 'conversational UIs'¬ù or 'conversational commerce'?
YOU: Sort of, but I'm not entirely sure what it's all about...
GRAHAM: It's the idea of using natural language - you know, chat, messaging, voice and the like - as the way of interacting with brands or services through things like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Siri.
GRAHAM: As a designer it's kind of exciting and terrifying in equal measures :-)
YOU: Sounds a bit space-age!
GRAHAM: No no, it's actually already here in some forms, and will be properly real fairly soon.
GRAHAM: Come along to my session and I'll explain it all and demonstrate some work on this I've done around retail banking services.
